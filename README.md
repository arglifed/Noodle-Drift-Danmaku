\# 🍜 Noodle Drift: Four Swords Edition



A neon-soaked, retro-arcade \*\*Danmaku Drift\*\* game. Navigate the broth, dodge the obstacles, and collect medals to become the ultimate Ramen Drifter.



\## 🕹️ Gameplay

You control a ramen bowl drifting through a high-speed soup stream. 



\* \*\*PC:\*\* Hold `SPACE` to drift right. Release to drift left.

\* \*\*Mobile:\*\* Touch and hold the screen to drift right. Lift your finger to drift left.



\## ✨ Scoring Mechanics

\* \*\*Survival:\*\* Your score increases the longer you stay in the bowl.

\* \*\*Medals (Yellow):\*\* Grab these for massive point boosts ($+1000$ points).

\* \*\*The Graze System:\*\* High-level players don't just dodge—they get close. Flying near obstacles without hitting them triggers a \*\*GRAZE\*\*, rewarding you with extra points and haptic feedback.
